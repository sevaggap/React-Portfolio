      Hi! My name is Sevag Gaprielian and I am an entry-level full stack developer.
      I completed my bachelorâ€™s degree in Aerospace Engineering at Ryerson University in 2019.
      After starting my career in 2020, I suffered a severe knee injury. I did not let this roadblock stop me, so after being completely healed, I enrolled in two Professional Certificate Courses through Coursera in Project Management and Data Analytics. Throughout the data course, I developed a passion for software development which led me to enroll in the UofT SCS Coding Bootcamp. I am eager to enter the software field and am confident that my abilities to pivot, learn new technologies, and build credibility, will help me transition to a role in the software field.
