## Description

Being a web developer means being part of a community. You’ll need a place not only to share your projects while you're applying for jobs or working as a freelancer but also to share your work with other developers and collaborate on projects.

The purpose of this project was to create a portfolio using React, which sets me apart from other developers whose portfolios don’t use the latest technologies. The application is also deployed on GitHub Pages.
